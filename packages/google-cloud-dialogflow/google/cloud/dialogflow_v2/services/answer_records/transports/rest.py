class AnswerRecordsRestInterceptor:
    """Interceptor for AnswerRecords.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the AnswerRecordsRestTransport.

                    Answer records are records to manage answer history and
                feedbacks for Dialogflow.

                Currently, answer record includes:

                -  human agent assistant article suggestion
                -  human agent assistant faq article

                It doesn't include:

                -  ``DetectIntent`` intent matching
                -  ``DetectIntent`` knowledge

                Answer records are not related to the conversation
                history in the Dialogflow Console. A Record is generated
                even when the end-user disables conversation history in
                the console. Records are created when there's a human
                agent assistant suggestion generated.

                A typical workflow for customers provide feedback to an
                answer is:

                1. For human agent assistant, customers get suggestion
                   via ListSuggestions API. Together with the answers,
                   [AnswerRecord.name][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.AnswerRecord.name]
                   are returned to the customers.
                2. The customer uses the
                   [AnswerRecord.name][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.AnswerRecord.name]
                   to call the
                   [AnswerRecords.UpdateAnswerRecord][google.cloud.dialogflow.v2.AnswerRecords.UpdateAnswerRecord]
                   method to send feedback about a specific answer that
                   they believe is wrong.
